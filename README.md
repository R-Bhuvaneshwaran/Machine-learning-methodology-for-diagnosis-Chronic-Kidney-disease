# Machine-learning-methodology-for-diagnosis-Chronic-Kidney-disease

# Abstract

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases.  Since there are no conspicuous side effects during the beginning phases of CKD, patients regularly neglect to see the illness.  Early discovery of CKD empowers patients to get opportune treatment to enhance the movement of this infection.  Machine learning models can successfully help clinicians accomplish this objective because of their quick and precise acknowledgment execution.

# Objective of the project

The main objective of developing this project is:
To develop machine learning model to predict future possibility of Kidney disease by implementing the Algorithms such as,
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. K-Nearest Neighbors


Dataset for this project is collected from the website kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease/code
